The bundled module is the unmodified signed release binary. Its source exposes
additional MSR reads and writes, but Ramag calls only `ioctl_read_smn` with the
fixed temperature register `0x59800`; it does not expose arbitrary SMN offsets,
MSR operations, or tuning. Each SMN read takes the bounded `Global\Access_PCI`
mutex required by the module source and releases it through an RAII guard.

PawnIO is installed and managed separately. Ramag does not install or start the
driver. Local hardware access is unverified when PawnIO is absent.
